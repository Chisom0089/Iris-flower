# INTRODUCTION
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, often used for pattern recognition. It is one of the earliest known datasets used for evaluating classification methods.


# PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. Iris flower dataset review.
2. Identification of initial insights and patterns.
3. Technical report with detailed observation of findings.


# DATA EXPLORATION
The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns of data. It is made up of 3 classes of Iris flowers with each class having 50 instances. I checked the dataset for duplicates, null values, outliers, and spelling errors and ensured all data types were correct. No duplicates or null values were found, and data types were consistent with the expected format.


# DATASET ATTTRIBUTE
The columns contains;
1. Sepal length in cm
2. Sepal width in cm
3. Petal length in cm
4. Petal width in cm
5. Class:
a. Iris Setosa
b. Iris Versicolour
c. Iris Virginica

# DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
MAXIMIUM VALUES
a. Iris Virginica has the maximum petal length (6.90 cm), petal width (2.50 cm), and sepal length (7.90 cm).

MINIMIUM VALUES
a. Iris Setosa has the minimum petal length (1.00 cm), petal width (0.10 cm), and sepal length (4.30 cm).

b. Iris Versicolour has the minimum sepal width (2.00 cm).

STANDARD DEVIATION
a. Iris Virginica has standard deviations of 0.55 cm (petal length), 0.27 cm (petal width), and 0.63 cm (sepal length).

b. Iris Setosa has the minimum standard deviation for petal length (0.17 cm), petal width (0.11 cm), and sepal length (0.35 cm).

c. Iris Setosa has the maximum standard deviation for sepal width.

These statistics suggest that Iris Virginica tends to have larger petals and sepals compared to the other species, while Iris Setosa generally has smaller and more consistent measurements.


# VISUAL ANALYSIS
I carried out an analysis to determine the distribution and correlation between features.
From the visuals (e.g., scatter plots, histograms), the following observations were made:
Iris Virginica: Highest average sepal length (6.6 cm), petal length (5.6 cm), and petal width (2.03 cm).
Iris Setosa: Least average sepal length (5.0 cm), petal length (1.5 cm), and petal width (0.24 cm).
Iris Versicolour: Least average sepal width (2.77 cm).

# CORRELATION ANALYSIS

The correlation analysis revealed the following:
Positive Correlations:
Sepal length shows a positive correlation with petal length.
Petal length shows a positive correlation with petal width.
No Correlations:
Sepal width shows no correlation with petal width.
Sepal length shows no correlation with sepal width.

# CONCLUSION
The analysis of the 3 classes of Iris flower dataset revealed key differences in sepal and petal measurements among Iris Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. Positive correlations were found between sepal and petal dimensions.  

Advanced classification techniques, principal component analysis, clustering algorithms, exploring additional morphological features, time-series growth pattern studies, and comparative studies with other botanical datasets. These approaches can enhance model accuracy and deepen understanding of plant morphology and growth.
